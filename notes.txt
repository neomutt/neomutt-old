widescreen view

use pager_index_lines as a width?
	0 implies use all width for pager

--devel-widescreen
USE_DEVEL_WIDESCREEN
bool index_widescreen = no

what about other screens?
	compose?  left: envelope, right: attachments?

index jumps up and down when too small for the window

need divider between index and pager
	separate window for divider
