In the index, the scroll wheel moves the cursor.
At what level is the translation from mouse to cursor happening?
If I don't process the mouse event, will the menu code process it later?
(Or does `mousemask` preclude any freebies -- if we use it, we need to implement all behaviour)

mousemask seems to stop all other mouse processing

trap mouse 4/5 (scroll-wheel) and turn into standard Menu cursor up/down
does this need to be configurable?

mouse wheel flick events will accelerate before dropping off
	should move *view*, but not the cursor/highlight

change notification to Window->event()?
	what other common events should supported?
