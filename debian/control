Description: textbased mailreader which gathers all the patches against Mutt
 NeoMutt is a sophisticated text-based Mail User Agent supporting MIME, GPG,
 PGP and threading.
 .
 NeoMutt was created when Richard Russon (FlatCap) took all the old
 Mutt patches, sorted through them, fixed them up and documented
 them.
 .
 It's not a fork of Mutt.  It's a large set of feature patches (big
 and small) that apply to Mutt.
 .
